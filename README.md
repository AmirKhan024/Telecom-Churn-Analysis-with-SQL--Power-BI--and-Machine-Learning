## Objective 
 To analyze customer churn in the telecom industry, derive actionable insights, and predict future customer churn using a Random Forest classifier, with an interactive Power BI dashboard for business decision-making.

 ## Steps and Workflow
 ### 1. Data Collection: 
   Acquired customer data from a telecom company dataset.
   
 ### 2. Data Cleaning & Exploration (SQL): 
   Removed duplicates and null values.
   Performed exploratory data analysis using SQL queries to identify key features influencing churn.
   
 ### 3. Visualization (Power BI): 
   Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize churn trends, customer demographics, and retention metrics.
 
 ### 4. Machine Learning Model: 
   -- Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict churned customers.
   
   -- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTENN().
   
   -- Hyperparameter-tuned the model for better performance.
   
 ### 5. Evaluation and Deployment: 
   Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
